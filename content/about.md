Hi there, I'm Mosaab.

I'm -theoretically- studying **computer science** at faculty of engineering, Mansoura university.

I'm **Web developer**, **blogger** and somehow I want to make difference in my life at any field I'm interested in.

I volunteered for some **organizations** like :

 1. [CAT Reloaded](https://www.facebook.com/CATReloaded/?ref=br_rs):
   I was team leader for python part of back-end circle
 
 2. [IEEE Mansoura student branch](https://www.facebook.com/IEEEManSB/):
   I was member of marketing committee and leader of media committee

<hr>

I presented some **technical talks** about various aspects :

## Some extra personal info.

I love reading, my relation with reading is strange but I love it very much, you can add me on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10778137-mosaab) where you can find ( what I already read with some reviews, what I want to read, etc. ) .

I love writing, I write in many fields (personal thoughts, politics, memories, etc.), I've a personal [blog](http://www.mosaab4.blogspot.com) on [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com), you can check it, I stopped publishing in it for a while but maybe I'll back to publish personal blogs someday.

I love watching movies, series and documentaries, you can find my list of watched movies [here](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur95343777/watchlist), you can also follow me on [TV Time](https://www.tvtime.com/en/user/10847087/profile) .

I love music but I've not a certain type of music to follow or a certain platform that I stuck with.
